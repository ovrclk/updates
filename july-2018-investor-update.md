# Investor Update: July 2018

San Francisco summer is upon us, bringing unexpectedly warm weather in lieu of the customary blowing fog at 15ºC. So the windows at Overclock HQ are wide open, allowing the team a glimpse of sunlight as we hunch over our keyboards, striving as always toward the launch of the Akash Network.  Quite a bit has happened since my last letter, so I’d like to share what we’ve accomplished and what we’ve learned.  First though, my apologies for missing the last couple investor letters. We’ve been busy of course, but that’s a poor excuse for not communicating with our community - it won’t happen again. Now onward!

### Testnet!

**By far the most significant development since my last letter is the first deployment of the Akash Testnet!**  As of July 10, 2018 [my blog is now LIVE on Akash](http://gregosuri.147.75.70.13.nip.io/), with Packet as our very first provider.  To drive the point home, this is the first time in HISTORY that a standard, Ruby-based web app has been deployed on a decentralized cloud.

Thanks to the entire Akash team for this incredible milestone - now let’s take a deeper dive into our product plans.

### Product

We continue to focus on the fundamental task of all software companies: shipping code and iterating on it.  We released [our public roadmap](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/blob/master/_docs/roadmap.md) in May and have continued to meet and exceed the deadlines in it. 

In June, we released [v2 of our public prototype](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.2.0), in which we integrated the previously-released [marketplace](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.0.5) with our deployment platform. This was a **huge milestone** because for the first time, users can execute the entire end-to-end workflow: from request to auction to deployment to deprovisioning, with tokens flowing as appropriate in each stage.  Check out [our demo video](https://akash.network/#akashInAction) to see it in action.

For July, we’ve decided to go for it.  We deferred our "P2P filesharing" milestone in favor of something much more impactful - our testnet launch!  The testnet takes the core features we developed for our June milestone and makes them publicly available for deployment on provider hardware. As I mentioned above, it’s up and running for internal deployments now - the next step is to harden/secure it, add minor features, and link it to a public-facing registration flow.  It’s a hard push, but by the end of July users will be able to obtain deployments and deploy to provider hardware in four POPs, San Jose, NYC, Amsterdam, and Tokyo.  Again, hats off to the entire team - I’m even rolling up my sleeves and coding again!

### Engagement and fundraising: By the numbers

Let’s start with a quantitative comparison of some important metrics between last letter and today.

Clearly we’ve made significant progress in building community and that growth fueled a community presale round that we ended in June.  We’ve now switched focus in favor of targeting anchor investors whose high liquidity is a prerequisite for success in a token economy and whose investment is a strong signal for other potential investors.  

Our initial attempts to find a suitable anchor among international funds were unsuccessful, in large measure (based on prospect feedback) due to the project’s lack of hype.  The truth that these funds are very hype-driven put us at a disadvantage because that particular aspect of the crypto "game" is not our strength - product is.  Therefore we’ve focused our product efforts on the most externally-impactful milestone - the testnet - because it provides competitive advantage in a market with many players but few functioning products.  

With this soon in place, we’ve now engaged \[name redacted - not yet announced\] to get us in front of Asian funds quickly, and are beginning to reach out through our existing investor/advisor network for introductions to appropriate anchor funds.

### Marketing and Press

Our product progress notwithstanding, amplification of our message is still a critical element. Our impressive community growth has been entirely organic and while this is laudable, it isn’t scalable.  So we are making some targeted investments to broaden our community and deepen its engagement - bringing in outside resources whose expertise complements our own, specifically:

* [Upholder](http://www.upholder.io/): A community-focused ICO Services Firm.  We kicked off with them at the beginning of July and are treating the first month as a test, with a limited engagement targeting Telegram and Reddit.  We’ve been very pleased by their work so far - assuming a successful test period, we will expand the engagement to include airdrop and bounty campaigns as well.
* [Autonomos](https://www.autonomos.capital/): A blockchain advisory firm run by our advisor Jaron.  We’ve engaged them for targeted introductions to influencers whose support is critical to our growth.  I’ve already been interviewed by [Crypto Crow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-UrU0OmJ3s&t=118s) and [Crypto Sally](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vgvyKk6t9g&t=3s), with decent community growth resulting from each.  More to come there.

We continue being very active internally, with notable recent activity including:

* Articles in [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/article/6-ways-cloud-computing-technology-is-changing-cm957002), [Entrepreneur](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315434), [Inc.](https://www.inc.com/darren-heitner/3-unexpected-ways-blockchain-will-change-world.html), and [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/jerrysmith/5-exciting-technologies-to-watch-in-2018-3akb5?utm_term=.valxV6OGwj#.uu2Q2LWqaO)
* A stealthy demo video promotion in [Hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/behind-the-scenes-at-akash-studios-18c718d59bff)
* The podcasts above, plus [Bad Crypto](https://badcryptopodcast.com/2018/07/12/crypto-spotlight-37/) and [Talking Cryptocurrency](https://jasonrigden.com/categories/talking-cryptocurrency/)
* Press releases announcing our [Packet partnership and MVP](https://coinidol.com/overclock-labs-releases-akash-network-mvp/) and our [Zeus partnership](https://medium.com/zeus-protocol-blog/zeus-protocol-the-intelligent-blockchain-partners-with-the-akash-network-a-visionary-b69b5fe10b1d), with several more on the way
* An upcoming long-form promotional video from Futurism, to be released in July
* Ramping our ICO listing site coverage and quality, with 15 sites listing us and 8 more in the pipe

### Partnerships

Our partnership with Packet is kicking into high gear as we gratefully use their capacity to fuel our testnet. We’ve also signed partnerships with:

* Zeus Protocol to provide identity and reputation
* Polyverse to provide exploit-resistant polymorphic Linux and as a compute consumer
* Life360 as a compute consumer
* SesameOpen as a demand channel experiment

### Legal

We amended our SEC Form D filing to have a 506(c) exemption, which allows us to perform general solicitation, but requires US persons to be accredited investors.  As before, we’re using Shufti to provide KYC/AML checks, and have added VerifyInvestor to perform accreditation checks as and when needed.  However, in an abundance of caution, we do not intend to accept funds from US persons, regardless of accreditation status. We believe there is more than sufficient international demand for investment and can thereby limit our risk exposure in this still-evolving regulatory environment.

### Events

As I mentioned in my last letter, we’ve generally ramped down our participation in events, as the ROI just isn’t there. Nonetheless, we will always participate in a targeted way with event that align with our goals. For example, Nick [spoke about our mission](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fXcpbXw9n4) at a NYC Blockchain Week event, and we both pitched a select group of investors at a recent Silicon Valley Blockchain Society event.

### And as always

Finally, thank you all again. The whole Akash team is grateful for your support of our mission of open, decentralized internet infrastructure!

Onward!

Greg and the Akash Team
