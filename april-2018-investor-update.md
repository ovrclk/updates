Spring is upon us and the team’s activity level continues to ramp. We’ve made significant progress in some areas and are facing challenges in others. I’d like to share what we’re doing and what we’ve learned in March.

### Legal

We’ve just [filed our SEC Form D](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1734871/000173487118000002/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml) with a 506(b) exemption for up to $5MM in the current round. While we are still targeting accredited investors only, this exemption also allows some non-accredited investors into the round, which is beneficial for our previous early friends and family investors.

However the 506(b) exemption does not allow general solicitation or advertising. A 506(c) exemption will, but strictly limits us to accredited investors (for US persons; there is no accreditation requirement for non-US persons). Cooley has determined that we need a more thorough process for verifying accreditation. We’ve identified a vendor ([Coinlist](https://coinlist.co/)) to perform these verifications and assume liability for them, but at non-trivial cost. Therefore we plan to use part of the capital to be raised under 506(b) to fund the processes needed for 506(c) compliance.

Meanwhile, we’ve implemented an automated third party KYC/AML service ([Shufti](https://shuftipro.com/)) to verify all investors. We will roll the service out to automatically verify all new whitelist signups this week and will circle back with existing whitelist members and investors shortly after.

### Fundraising

Our fundraising progress has slowed significantly, based on a number of factors including market climate and an intentional slowdown while we established Reg D compliance. We’ve also received feedback from potential investors on areas to focus more attention on, most notably around tokenomics, liquidity, and proof points to demonstrate early traction. This feedback has been helpful in guiding our work to evolve both our pitch and our offering.

That said, we have a pipeline of 153 leads who’ve signed up for our whitelist, as well as an untapped pool of potential investors in the networks of our current investors and advisors. With Form D and KYC/AML verification in place, we are ready to tap both pools. As mentioned, we’ll be reaching out to convert whitelist members shortly. I’ll be contacting you very soon to gratefully request referrals to your respective networks.

### Product

On March 19 we [announced](https://www.coinannouncer.com/overclock-announces-akash-network-a-blockchain-powered-compute-marketplace-to-disrupt-the-cloud-oligopoly/) the [open-sourcing of our software](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/) and the release of our public prototype, described at length in my previous letters to you. It marked the achievement of our first major product milestone and I couldn’t be prouder of the team!

Since then, we’ve been making steady progress on implementing more core features, with weekly releases [tagged in the repo](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases) and publicized in our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/AkashNW).

Our next big milestone will be public availability of our testnet.  This will obviously be a huge milestone so as development work continues we will devise a set of sensible interim milestones for tracking purposes - stay tuned for those.

### Rebranding

As you probably know, we’ve successfully (and finally!) completed rebranding Photon as The Akash Network. Trademark applications have been filed, new logo and [brand guidelines](https://akash.network/static/AKASH_Brand_Guidelines.pdf) have been finalized, all content has been updated, and we’ve begun to push hard on media. Those of you who’ve participated in rebranding will understand how happy I am to have this milestone behind us!

### Marketing

Speaking of media, we’ve been generating a ton of paid, earned, and owned content recently.  A few highlights include:

* A [social video](https://futurism.com/videos/sponsored-blockchain-democratizing-cloud/) and [article](https://futurism.com/sponsored-new-provider-democratizing-cloud/) from Futurism. The video alone generated almost 90,000 views.

* A blog series in Hacker Noon [announcing Akash](https://hackernoon.com/introducing-akash-f1789e18b4ac) and discussing our [mission](https://hackernoon.com/decentralized-infrastructure-is-a-moral-imperative-2ec13dc3138d) and [values](https://hackernoon.com/on-transparency-d193be655285).

* Articles in [ZDNet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/want-to-profit-from-your-underused-servers-overlook-has-an-idea/), [Network World](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3267952/data-center/overclock-puts-your-idle-servers-to-work-for-other-people.html), and [TG Daily](http://www.tgdaily.com/cryptocurrency-and-blockchain/blockchain-platform-akash-wants-to-reward-companies-for-renting-their-extra-computing-power). 

Our PR strategy includes getting published in these lower-tier publications quickly. With those as a base, we will begin targeting top-tier publications. None of this content has discussed our token offering due to the prohibition against general solicitation or advertising in our 506(b) exemption.  When we’ve filed the 506(c), the focus of our efforts will shift to generating interest via influencer marketing, coin listing/review sites, and other general channels - most likely in cooperation with a crypto marketing firm.

We’ve organically grown our Telegram channel from 60 on March 9 to 601 today - impressive on a relative scale but we’ll also be looking for outside help to continue that trend.

### Partnerships

We’re very excited to have signed a MOU with [name redacted], a leading bare-metal hosting provider, to provide initial capacity to the network. We will announce this partnership shortly.

Packet is the first of many MOUs/LOIs we hope to sign soon. Frankly, we should have had more in place by now but haven’t made it enough of a priority.  However belatedly, we will be prioritizing biz dev efforts in April and May. Our LOI with [name redacted] is in review and we hope to have that finalized soon; we have a short list of other firms as well.  Again, your networks would be invaluable to us in this area - we’d especially appreciate CIO-level introductions to companies who might want to monetize their slack server capacity on Akash.

**A note on ROI**

Going forward, look for us to spend less time and money on event booths and afterparties. While attribution is notoriously difficult with large events, we are skeptical of their ROI. We will still participate at selected events but feel that time is better spent speaking before targeted groups of investors and leaders and that money is better spent in pursuit of quantifiable outcomes.

### And as always

Finally, thank you all again. The whole Akash team is grateful for your support of our mission of open, decentralized internet infrastructure!

Onward!

Greg and the Akash Team
